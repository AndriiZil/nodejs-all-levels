# Events

- One benefit of using events instead of regular callbacks is that we can react to the same signal multiple times by
  defining multiple listeners.

* .emit() - this method in event emitter is to emit an event in module
* .on() - this method is to listen to data on a registered event in node.js
* .once() - it listen to data on a registered event only once.
* .addListener() - it checks if the listener is registered for an event.
* .removeListener() - it removes the listener for an event.
